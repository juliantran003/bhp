        Whether you are an artist, publisher, student, educator, organiser,
        curator, or just a friend of Palestine – we need your solidarity. We ask
        you to join our collective boycott of HP branded products and services,
        in line with BDS and PACBI guidelines.<br></br>
        <br></br>

          I pledge to boycott all HP products and services until they stop
          providing services to the Israeli military:

        <br></br>
        <br></br> If you currently own an HP branded printer this looks like
        using non-HP-branded ink, until it is time to replace your printer. If
        you currently own an HP branded computer it looks like switching to
        another computer brand, when your current computer reaches the end of
        its life.<br></br>

        <span className="green">
          I pledge to be responsible for the production of my creative work and
          the reproduction of my intellectual property:

        <br></br>
        This looks like making it clear to printers, publishers, magazines,
        galleries, art collectives, universities and anyone else who reproduces
        your work, that you have committed to an HP- free practice. It is
        reasonable to ask for transparency surrounding the way your work is
        reproduced and it is reasonable to ask for receipts. You can find an
        ongoing list of commercial printers <a href="">here </a> who don’t use
        HP printers or inks. <br></br>
        <br></br> As a publisher, this looks like ensuring that nothing printed
        under your press is done so on an HP printer or using HP ink. If you are
        printing books digitally there are many alternatives to the well known
        HP Indigo, you can find a list of commercial printers who do not use an
        HP Indigo <a href="">here </a>. If you are a publisher who does not
        currently use HP to print your books, you should be vigilant that you
        are not using HP for other printed matter, be that in your office,
        posters for book launches, inserts for books, slipcases, greetings
        cards, etc. <br></br>

          I pledge to tell others about the consequences of supporting HP
          branded products:<br></br>
          <br></br>
        </span>{" "}
        This can look like talking to friends, family, colleagues, peers,
        educators, students, neighbours.
